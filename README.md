# Covid sounds

uses api from covidtracking.com to get info of covid positive cases in the US.

Plays a sound when positive cases increase.

# INFO

-Uses python. (install vlc with pip install python-vlc)

-Runs on my raspberry pi and connects to my bluetooth speaker.

-Checks every hour to see if cases have increased.

# TODO

For testing it just checks every 5 seconds. Due to the data updating only a few times a day, I have a little incr to increase the cases by one so the sounds plays way more often. Once Testing is done, this will be taken out.
